__Story1__ : ** Your car has blown a tire on a winding road in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone reception. You decide to
hitchhike. A rusty pickup truck rumbles to a stop next to your. A man with a wide brimmed hat and soulless eyes opens the
passenger door for you and says: "Need a ride, boy?". <br /> <br />
  __Answer1a__: I'll hop in. Thanks for the help!<br />
Story3: As you begin to drive, the stranger starts talking about his relationship with his mother. He gets angrier and
angrier by the minute. He asks you to open the glove box. Inside you find a bloody knife, two severed fingers, and
a cassette tape of Elton John. He reaches for the glove box.<br /><br />
  __Answer3a__: I love Elton John! Hand him the cassette tape.<br /><br />
__Story6__: You bond with the murderer while crooning verses of "Can you feel the love tonight". He
drops you off at the next town. Before you go he asks you if you know any good places to dump bodies. You reply:
"Try the pier."<br /><br />
  __Answer3b__: It’s him or me. Take the knife and stab him.<br /><br />
__Story5__: As you smash through the guardrail and careen towards the jagged rocks below you reflect
on the dubious wisdom of stabbing someone while they are driving a car you are in.
  __Answer1b__: Well, I don't have many options. Better ask him if he's a murderer.<br /><br />
__Story2__: He nods slowly, unphased by the question.<br /><br />
  __Answer2a__: At least he's honest. I'll climb in.<br /><br />
